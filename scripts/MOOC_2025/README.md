# Python Programming MOOC 2025 – Solutions


This folder contains organized `.py` solutions for each section of the [Python Programming MOOC 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/) course.

## Structure

Scripts were pulled from [P4r1nc3 repo](https://github.com/P4r1nc3/Python_Programming_MOOC_2025_I) -- Give creds if you find this useful

Each `partXX/` folder includes the extracted solution `.py` files from its corresponding section of the course. These were pulled from their original nested `src/` directories to simplify navigation and review.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to serve as a reference for anyone working through the course who may:

* Want to double-check their code
- Need help getting past a tricky exercise
- Prefer reviewing clean, working examples without deep folder nesting

This is not intended to bypass the course material — it's a support resource to help learners keep progressing without getting stuck.

## Notes

 Only final `.py` solutions are included — no extra files or scaffolding. Everything is kept minimal and accessible.

 If this helps you, great. Keep learning, keep coding.
