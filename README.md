# redmind-scripts

A collection of small, pragmatic scripts and notes I actually use—focused on hands‑on workflows over heavy frameworks. 

This repo is meant as a personal toolbox and reference; if you stumbled in here, feel free to use anything that helps you.

## What’s Inside

- **Scripts** for everyday ops, networking, security, and Git hygiene
- **Readme docs** in each folder with quick usage notes
- Minimal dependencies; designed to run on common Linux systems (Mint/Ubuntu/Debian), with some Windows/Powershell helpers where noted

---

## Notes

- These scripts are intentionally simple and opinionated. PRs welcome if they keep that spirit.
- Use at your own risk; always read a script before running it on a live system.
